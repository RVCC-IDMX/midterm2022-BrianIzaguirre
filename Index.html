                 <h3>How We Work:</h3>

                    <p> Our team designs a perfessional and simple website for users to easily navagate through. We draw out an animation of the 
                    layout of the website with any features and themes we think would be best then confirm whether the customer is satisfied
                     or not.</p>
                
                 <p>If you have a layout already planned out with listed features then great! give it to us and our team will have it 
                    finished in no time. Once the website is completed we let our customers try it out for themselves to see if their requirments
                    and satisfactions are met.</p>
